        <h2 class="story">The story</h2>

        <p class="first-paragraphe">Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all
            of his neighbors came
            around to commiserate. They said, <q class="villager">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This
                is most
                unfortunate.</q> The farmer said, <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe.</em></q>
        </p>
        <p>The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the
            evening everybody came back and said,<q class="villager">Oh, isn't that lucky. What a great turn of events.
                You now have eight
                horses!</q> The farmer again said, <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe.</em></q>
        </p>
        <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while
            riding it,he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <q class="villager">Oh dear, that's too
                <tag class="bad">bad</tag>,</q> and the farmer
            responded, <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe.</em></q>
        </p>
        <p>The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected
            his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="villager">Isn't
                that great!</q> Again, he
            said, <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe.</em></q>
        </p>
        <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it's really impossible
            to tell whether anything that happens in it is <tag class="Good">good</tag> or <tag class="bad">bad</tag> â€”
            because you never know what will be the
            consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <tag class="Good">good
            </tag> fortune.

        <h2 class="morale">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            <tag class="Good">Good</tag> and <tag class="bad">bad</tag> are just one perspective. Bananas are <tag
                class="Good">good</tag> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <tag class="Good">good</tag> for bananas.
            Let's not make a big deal out of it...
